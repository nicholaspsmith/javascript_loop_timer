Testing the performance of the for loop vs array.forEach in javascript

Here is a sample of the output:

    foreach took: 286 milliseconds
    for loop took: 1172 milliseconds
    foreach was faster by 886 milliseconds
    (function(){}()) took: 415
    (function(){})() took: 420
    var i = function(){}(); took: 417
    0, function(){}(); took: 417
    !function(){}(); took: 425
    ~function(){}(); took: 438
